      <p>About Me

        Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Preeya, a budding web developer with a passion for crafting digital experiences. I'm on a journey to learn and grow in the exciting world of programming. 
        My Journey with technology began recently as I've been drawn to the creativity and problem-solving aspects of coding. Even since I took the leap into the world of web development, I've been hooked!
        In terms of my skills and expertise, I'm still early in my journey. I am gaining a foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        I have enjoyed bringing designs to life and creating user-friendly interfaces that engage and delight users.
        My ultimate goal is to become a proficient full-stack developer, capable of building robust and scalable web solutions. I'm dedicated to continuous learning and improvement, and I'm excited to see where this journey takes me!
        I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts. Whether you have a project idea, want to collaborate, or just chat about all things coding, feel free to reach out!</p>
